Some Common misconceptions 
A class will have methods and variables
   class Car{
       String name;
       int horsePower;

       void start(){
           System.out.println("starting the car:" + name);
       }

       void stop(){
           System.out.println("stopping the car:" + name);
       }
   }
In above we defined name as variable and start and stop are methods
Car c1 = new Car();
   Car c2 = new Car();

   c1.start(); // this is calling the methods and at this time computer will run the instructions in the method start
   c1.stop();

   c2.start();
   c2.stop();
In above we have created 2 objects c1 and c2.
Car c1 = new Car();
   Car c2 = new Car();

   c1.start(); // this is calling the methods and at this time computer will run the instructions in the method start
   c1.stop();

   c2.start();
   c2.stop();
In above we have created 2 objects c1 and c2.
Constructors
Lets create a class like Person and create a object.
   class Person{
       String name;

       void printDetails(){
           System.out.println("name is=" + name);
       }
   }

   class Application{
       public static void main(String[] args){
           Person p1 = new Person();
           p1.printDetails();
       }
   }
When you run the above program you will see
name is=null
This is bcause you didnt declare the name in any sort of way


The method we have added has some unique characteristics
   Person(String  inputname){

   }
* It has the same name as class name (Person)
* It does not return anything (for normal method when they don't return anything you need to specify void but for this you cannot type anything)
* The parameters are just like any other methods where you can have 0 or multiple parameters.
* This is method is called when you are creating the object and hence it is called Constructor
