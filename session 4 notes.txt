Variables
Any character can be used to describe a variable, usually we use x.
You can assign your variable with anything
 
Data types
You can classify types of data in different ways, like numbers or strings, so you can get answers of different types in different orders
You have to tell java what kind of info you want, like age=37. Age is the variable and int is the data type, since int means number.


Syntax
Syntax is like grammar in java programming.
Like the way we put a . at the end of a sentence, you have to put a ; at the end of each line in a program


If statement
With this, you can basically get any kind of output from the computer based on your requirements
Use if, else if, if else, and else for your if statement.


Loops
One kind of loop is for loop.
This is used for making things repeat themselves, like making helloworld come ten times on the console


Curly brackets
A curly bracket {} is used for starting and finishing programs.
Every { needs to have a } otherwise you will get a syntax error
