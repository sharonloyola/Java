Syntax
Syntax is the grammar of programming. 
Its very easy to program java if you know the syntax


If 
If (...){}
Condition is basically a yes or no question. 


Else if, else
Else if is another condition
If it’s a yes for the if, it will come down to the else if
Else is for anything else that can happen


For 
For can be used as a loop    
for(...;...;..){}




Custom data types (class)
You define variables here
Basically you make variables
Remember to not click the check mark during making this class


Class
Class can be thought of as a template, cookie cutter, blueprint, etc.


actions/methods/functions/behavior
Actions are things you do, like run, play
Read, read harry potter
You can use these in java programming


Actions in programming
   class Person{
       // no input
       // no output
       void run(){

       }

       // input : bookName
       // output: none
       void readBook(String bookName){

       }

       // input: none
       // output: miles ran
       int tellMeMilesRanToday(){
           return 10;
       }

       // input: money
       // output: coffee
       String getCoffee(int money){
           return "latte";
       }
   }
Like this, we can ask and give back info using data types and actions


Calculator program
   class Calculator{
       int add(int x, int y){
           int z;
           z = x+y;
           return z;
       }

       int sub(int x, int y){
           int z;
           z = x-y;
           return z;
       }
   }
We can do simple addition here


Sum can be very helpful here
Sum is nothing but a variable, but we use it to help get the addition sums


Note action is actually called method
Scope
This declares when a variable is alive and dead using {}
When it is alive it is still to be used in the program
When a variable is dead it is done being used and is determined by }
This way you can use the same variable twice and it won’t have to mean the same thing 
(But you must declare it twice)
